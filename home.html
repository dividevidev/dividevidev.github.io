                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Hello guys! üôÇ (read everything before you decide to send me a message) Please send me a message ONLY If you're in the same situation and If your expectations are the same as mine.I want to find like minded people from Europe (Why Europe? Read my post to find out) I'm looking for something permanent (remember - you can feel lonely even If you're surrounded by others - If there's no emotional bond) I'm fed up of meeting people who never make time for me &amp; only text me once or twice a week to ask me "what are you up to?" Out of boredom.I don't want to meet people asking others a million of questions like "what's your favorite movie?" Just to give them one word answer and ask them another question "and music? Your favorite song?" I'm looking for something "deeper" &amp; different üòä</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">What kind of friend would I like to find? Someone to talk to on a daily basis - Someone who needs It &amp; wants It just as much as me</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">What are my expectations? I would like to meet someone in a similar situation ‚Äì why? Because I honestly feel like only a person with the same expectations and a similar outlook on life would get along with me &amp; because I feel more comfortable talking to people like me..Friendless people who need a strong bond - people without friends and partners.. Don't get me wrong‚Ä¶Most people deserve to be happy and It's good to have friends but people who have friends or families in real life are usually more focused on them (which is completely understandable) &amp; have less time for others + I simply don't want to be replaced by anyone..I kind of envy people who can call others , true friends given I don't have an emotional bond with any of my acquaintances. Please send me a message only If you're not In a relationship and don't have friends for the same reasons I've already mentioned before</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚òÖ</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Whenever I hear that others have friends I simply get sad because (believe it or not) If I had to choose between 20 people to talk to (acquaintances) and one special person - I'd choose that one special person without any hesitation .</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">I also want to talk to others every day because..I want to see someone‚Äôs effort &amp; be someone's first choice - not another person to have random conversations with..some people ask me "Why do you want to talk to people from Europe?" Well..Because I would like to see someone I'd get along with - In the far future - face to face :) + I don't want to wait any longer than 6 hours to receive a message - waiting 6 hours to receive a message is more than enough</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">I'm by no means criticizing people who don't want to talk to others often / People who really are super busy &amp; People who want to find someone to have unimportant conversations with - I'm aware that not everyone has the same expectations which is why everything you're reading now - is here for a reason :) All I'm suggesting is - I don't want anything temporary and I don't want to be the one always giving more than receiving.Listen people - I used to ignore being..ignored by others..always being just an option to talk to during tough times or moments of boredom.I was too young to realize that I was never important enough for most people that were a part of my life. I don't know who needs to hear this but..No one is too busy to make time for you! People make excuses to avoid others because they prioritize everything and (maybe) everyone..over them. It's true that most people are busy - but It takes only a few seconds to start a conversation (If you're into short messages) and a few minutes (1-10/15) to type a long message . Don't let anyone lie to you.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Truth is that most people either don't like you enough to make time for you or just simply - feel no need to talk to others often but are they too busy? No..You don't need to send me a message just to ask me and tell me "Do you really want to talk every day? I like long messages but I can't promise to contact you often" If you really are unsure please don't send me a message.I don't need more acquaintances aka people to talk to - occasionally.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">I'm not trying to sound rude but conversations once or twice a week wouldn't be enough for me and I don't need them... Let me tell you one thing ‚Äì A true friend would never just give up on you for no reason :) It‚Äôs always possible to find someone to have a random conversation with ‚Äì someone willing to send you one message once or twice a week..but..It‚Äôs almost impossible to find people willing to make more time for you.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">I‚Äôm not asking a busy person to make time for me by changing some plans! Absolutely not! I‚Äôm here to find someone who wants to talk daily (throughout the day or maybe even night) of one‚Äôs own will.Someone looking for the same kind of connection.Strong friendships are based on mutual support. One of the best things you can do for a friend in need, is just to be there for them when they want to talk.I often see posts from people who always say how friendless they are because they don't feel loved or appreciated by their "friends" remember! A true friend - someone who truly likes you or someone who wants to get to know you - will always find time for you.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">I'm not interested in small talk/short messages - I love long and meaningful conversations. It's so easy to find someone who loves abbreviations and questions like "How are you?" How was your day? Or what are you interested in? But so hard/almost impossible to find a person who knows how to keep a conversation going &amp; show others some effort.Building and maintaining friendships takes time and effort.Never allow pursuits or possessions to become bigger priorities than your relations with other people.Close friendships are so important to us because they are so difficult to form + Having friends can help you feel as if you belong to something that brings purpose and connection to your life</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ I do NOT respond to any ‚ÄûHey,hmu‚Äù or ‚Äûu want to talk?‚Äù type of messages (super short messages or messages full of abbreviations ‚Äì I literally can‚Äôt stand abbreviations and acronyms in text messages) ALL messages full of abbreviations will immediately be ignored.I also don't like it when people ignore everything I say in private messages just to focus on a random question or? When they start talking only about themselves and don't ever ask me anything. I love conversations with people referring to everything I say...I want everything I say and do - to be reciprocated</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ No NSFW profiles (checking mental health subreddits NOT included as I'm a huge empath and always try to understand others) - Please! I'm not looking for anyone to flirt with and I'm not looking for a partner either. I always check people's profiles (even comment history) - To avoid guys, trying to get inappropriate pictures from adult women or? flirt with them + I don't want to see you with no clothes on so If you're on Reddit only because you want others to see what's underneath your clothes - I'm not for you! I just simply don't want to see any s e x related activity on your profile If you want to talk to me.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ If both of us (you and I) are from the same country (I live in a non-English speaking country) - I want to communicate with you in our first language! No - Not because I don't understand English - because as you see - I do. Why then? English is simply overrated and people don't appreciate other languages as much as they should. So.. If we're from the same country and you want to talk only in English (which is quite common on reddit) - Talk to someone else. I just don't want to talk to a person from the same country as mine - in a foreign language as It's just something I don't understand even If all you want is to improve your language skills</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ Please only adult people 18-36 (age range) It doesn't matter to me If you're younger or older than me (as long as you're not underage) So.. don't worry! I just want to have discussions with emotionally mature people :)</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt respond to messages I don‚Äôt find interesting even If they're long - If after receiving and reading your message I don't feel comfortable or think "I wouldn't get along with him/her" I simply do not respond (what I‚Äôm suggesting is that I don‚Äôt always respond to someone‚Äôs first or second message because..sometimes you just know If you‚Äôd get along with someone or not- I‚Äôd never ignore anyone after days or weeks of daily conversations though) just because I don‚Äôt want to do anything forcefully &amp; because I don‚Äôt want to lead anyone on. I read all messages but I definitely don't respond to all of them! I want to make it clear because I don't want to be accused of not responding and not reading people's messages! - Some people don't message me back as well and even If It's a bit disappointing I'm ok with that! - as long as there's no emotional bond - Not responding to someone's first or second message Is completely OK! If people think they wouldn't get along with a stranger - is there a reason to start a conversation? I don't think so. I can't stand being ignored after days or weeks of daily conversations and seeing people changing priorities over time.. but that's something different - something I don't want to go through ever again for real. If I'm really interested in someone's message it's impossible to hear from me "I'm too busy" because I know myself and If I had no time for others - I wouldn't be here. I don't want to pretend to be someone I'm not and always try to find some cheap excuses to avoid others. (unlike most people who don't want to talk to others)</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ It would be better If you guys were into emojis - like me - to describe your emotions In text messages. Two emojis - üôÇ and üôÅ are completely enough! I just don't like emotionless conversations.I also don't like it when people say "yeah" or yea"as it sounds dismissively. First impression Is everything to me! I want to see your kindness even in a text message.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ I would rather talk to a homebody - not another person who always has something to do as people who are very busy don't even have time for daily conversations</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ If you're another person interested only in "childish conversations" such as "HEYOOO! I'M BORED! Ya like Pizza or cheese? xDDDD ü§£I'm begging you! Don't send me a message.I'm not a child anymore and such messages don't make me smile or laugh.I'm looking for someone interested In serious discussions - not another person just seeking some entertainment out of boredom . Conversations with sarcastic undertones (even when It comes to some emojis such as ü§£üòÇ) are not for me. Your typing style matters to me! Why? when It comes to online conversations with someone new - It's not always possible to know If someone Is laughing at you.. or with you</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ Time response matters to me a lot! I would never ask anyone to be online all day long and I'm NOT asking any of you for any instant messaging as I'm someone who would rather wait an hour or two to receive a proper response instead of some short and pointless messages but I'm interested only in daily conversations and I don't want to wait any longer than 6 hours to get a message from you.I don't need unbelievably long messages either! Messages as long as the second paragraph of my post - are completely enough. If you like longer messages? you can send me a longer message, but If you want to send me one word or one sentence as a response to my post - don't expect a reaction from me. I don't want to come across as rude - I just don't want to waste your time</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">‚Ä¢ I'm strongly AGAINST picking on people you don't even want to chat with - and making fun of them! I can't stand people who criticize others publicly or make fun of them! (only because they disagree with someone they don't even know) There's no place In my life for someone using Reddit, to hurt other people</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Why can‚Äôt you see any of my hobbies listed down below? Because what really matters to me is..who you are (If you‚Äôre honest, talkative ,understanding, caring and trustworthy ‚Äì for example) just simply ‚Äì It matters to me what you‚Äôre like! not what you like.Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì you can tell me what your hobbies are but from my point of view - people's hobbies are important - If you want to find a gaming buddy or If you want to meet someone to hang out with in real life and..go bowling for example.What most people seem to care about are other people's passions ‚Äì I don‚Äôt. I get along with other people despite having completely different hobbies but I absolutely don‚Äôt get along with people way different than me (different expectations and outlook on life ‚Äì way different sense of humor or personality traits ‚Äì It‚Äôs just an example) It doesn't make ANY DIFFERENCE to me If you're a gamer or? Someone interested in photography! It doesn't make any difference - &gt; as long as you're talkative and kind and If you also want to find someone willing to stay in your life..for good - But If you're into small talk and all you want is to...type and receive super short messages or If you're here only because you're bored and don't know what to do + If you're a very sarcastic person - I'm definitely not for you! I don't get along with overly sarcastic people turning everything into a joke. Friendships should be natural ‚Äì not forced. I wouldn't get along with people who laugh at everything.. In my opinion most people are way too sarcastic.. It's quite sad... Sarcasm can also be another form of passive-aggressive behavior.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">People who want to be to friends should feel comfortable and have something in common. No - not necessarily a similar taste in music or movies but something else..Most friendships don't fizzle out because of people not having the same hobbies but..because they just simply have different expectations when It comes to something important.I'm not here out of boredom and trust me - I'm not here to meet as many people as possible.I choose quality over quantity.I highly value myself and my time &amp; Sometimes one person but a person who makes you feel comfortable and understood - is more than enough :) We ALL can choose what kind of people we‚Äôd like to talk to and maybe even become really good friends with and I? I don‚Äôt want anyone to be disappointed.We all have some expectations after all.I know that people don't have to talk as often as possible in order to become friends but I'm interested only in daily conversations. If you really need someone to talk to due to loneliness and If you have time to talk to me daily (throughout the day and maybe even night) I always make time for others.I'm literally always available.I could even stay up all night long only to talk to someone important to me. I‚Äôm ready to commit but only If there‚Äôs some chemistry between me and someone else.I don‚Äôt do anything forcefully.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">If you want to talk to me tell me your story - tell me why you're here, what kind of friend would you like to meet :) Et cetera.Such messages are way more interesting to me than...someone's long list of hobbies. I know! It's unusual on reddit but I don't make friends based on hobbies..I want to meet someone with the same mindset as mine to finally feel understood and get close to someone new. You can share your problems with me - I absolutely don't mind "complaining" as I've been through a lot in my life.What do people usually tell you when you tell them that something's wrong? "Don't complain" or "Life's not over yet - one day you'll be happy" or "There are worse situations than yours" and..obviously "Find a therapist" Life's not a fairytale and sometimes things don't go as planned.Emotions shouldn't be bottled up.I'm sick of people always telling others "everything's gonna be ok" move on " &amp; more..Trust me people - not everyone wants to hear "Just believe in yourself and everything's gonna be ok" Some people take it as reassurance - but others? They would rather hear something different üôÅImagine being told that things will be okay, only for them to get worse..Do you guys know why telling someone "everything's gonna be ok" Is wrong? Because you can't see the future.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">ü§ç</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">You can't guarantee others that one day they'll finally be happy + when It comes to social interactions - We're responsible only for ourselves - not others &amp; as you guys know people let us down quite often (sometimes even when there's no reason) so instead of telling people how they should move on, forget everything and be happy or asking them to find a therapist - be there for them! Always be willing to listen to them If you really like them or want to get to know them &amp; don't suggest everyone in a tough situation to find a therapist because even the best therapist won't ever replace a true friend + It's quite normal to be disappointed If people always do something to hurt you. Sharing your hardships with other people in a very similar situation or exactly the same one - is VERY helpful If the other person understands you &amp; wants to start all over by just letting it all out! Feeling emotional support instead of always hearing some "positive quotes" or someone saying "Stop complaining let's talk about something else - Is very important! "Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. I appreciate sensitive people who always try to understand others. If after hearing a sad story all you want to say is "forget the past and move on" you're not for me. It's important to be a good listener and provide emotional support to others</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Please - If you're a completely different person than the described type of person I'm looking for (If you love abbreviations,If you don't need a stable friendship, If you're sarcastic and quiet) or If you simply disagree with my post - don't force yourself to send me a message.I want my new potential friendship to be natural which is why I want you to contact me only If your needs are the same - I don't want you to pretend to be someone you're not - only to please me - Pretending to be someone you're not - is the worst.I want to finally be happy again &amp; find someone "always" wanting to talk - sending me random pictures throughout the day - food pictures or pictures of some animals. What is the most important to me? I want to find people who value online friendships as much as they would value real life ones as there's another human being on the other side</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:0px;">I know It's possible to meet people with exactly the same expectations as mine but It's just not easy because most people are Interested In temporary and entertaining conversations. People like me are just "different" I really want to finally find someone who loves emojis as much as I do.. someone who loves sweet, warm and serious discussions at the same time. Emojis really do - change conversations üòä</p>
